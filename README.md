# TACTO Pro

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/zhangzrjerry/tactopro/python-package.yml)

TACTO Pro is a lightweight wrapper designed to streamline the creation of TACTO simulations, significantly reducing code complexity and boilerplate. It supports Python versions 3.8 through 3.12 (current `open3d` does not supoort 3.13).

With `tactopro`, there's no need to manually interact with the `tacto` package or write extensive custom code to sample tactile images. Simply follow this workflow:

```python
from tactopro import TactoPro, TactoConfig

tp = TactoPro("public/hkust.stl", config=TactoConfig())
frames = tp.sample_frames_uniformly(500)
tp.save(frames, "public/hkust")
```

After running the `example.py`, you'll get results similar to the following:

<p align="center"> 
    <img src="./public/hkust/illustration.png" width=60%>
    <img src="./public/hkust/rgbframes/17.png" width=10%>
</p>

## Setup

You can install TACTO Pro using pip:

```sh
pip install tactopro@git+https://github.com/ZhangzrJerry/TactoPro.git
```

Alternatively, clone the repository and install it manually:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ZhangzrJerry/TactoPro && cd TactoPro
pip install -e .
```
